BankBridge is a powerful banking management system that makes use of Java SWING graphical interfaces and a robust MySQL database. It is designed to handle all data and records related to bank accounts and customers, with a wide range of features for customers, bankers, and administrators.

Customers can easily view their account balances and banking accounts linked to them, while bankers have access to all banking accounts in the database and can perform various banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. Administrators have complete control over the system, allowing them to manage both banking accounts and user accounts. They can search through them, modify them, delete them, or add new ones as needed.

## Getting Started with BankBridge

Follow these simple steps to get started with BankBridge:

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

```
  Java IDE (We recommend IntelliJ IDEA)
  MySQL Workbench (already configured and running server)
```

### Installation

1. Import the bank.sql database schema into your MySQL server.
2. Verify that the values in conf.properties match your local MySQL server configuration.
3. Open the project folder in your preferred IDE.
4. Test the connection to the database from the IDE. If the conf.properties file was configured correctly, you should receive a successful connection message.
